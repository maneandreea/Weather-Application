# Weather-Application

The weather application is a web-based application that provides real-time weather information for a given location.
The user can input their location, or the application can use their device's GPS to determine their current location.
The application retrieves the weather data from an API and displays it in an easy-to-read format.
The user can also view the forecast up to 5 days.

** Please start the application using Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code ** <br>
** To check the weather in your desired city, type the city name in the search bar, then press the search button **
