# Weather-Application
The weather application is a web-based application that provides real-time weather information for a given location. 
The user can input their location, or the application can use their device's GPS to determine their current location. The application retrieves the weather data from an API and displays it in an easy-to-read format, such as a dashboard with a temperature gauge, a graph of temperature changes over time, and a map showing current weather patterns. The user can also view the hourly and daily forecast, as well as get alerts for severe weather conditions. The application may also include interactive features like weather-related games, educational resources, and social media integration for sharing weather updates. Overall, a weather application created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a useful and user-friendly tool for staying up-to-date on the latest weather conditions.

** Please start the application using Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code **
